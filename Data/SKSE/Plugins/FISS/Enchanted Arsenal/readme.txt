Preset Files



Please note that all of the XML files in this folder are required for the mod's
preset save/load functions to work correctly. Do not rename or remove these files.

However, if you would like to rename the preset names that appear in the MCM menu,
you can do so by opening any of the Preset 1-5.xml files, and changing the title
text found near the top between the <PresetTitle></PresetTitle> tags. This is a
much faster way to change the title of your presets than doing it from the MCM
menu (unfortunately, due to some restrictions with FISS, the entire file must be
read and re-written to rename it from the MCM menu, which takes a long time).





FISS version 1.21 or higher is required to use these presets. You can Google
"FISS Skyrim Nexus" - the first link found should take you to the download page.
